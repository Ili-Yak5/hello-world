# hello-world
My starting point!
I am challenged for several years to transition into IT by a childhood friend but I often claim to be so busy to start.
Today I start and I look forward to the uncertain possibilities of tomorrow with IT skills.
Hope you will hold my hands!
I hope I can walk this path with my coffee!!!
